# K-mean--scala
K-means    Either a set of unlabeled learning data in dimension 2 contained in the file Data1.txt One has for a set of examples to classify two characteristics. This learning set includes 132 examples that have been simulated according to 3 Gaussians.      Explain the principle, the nature and the different stages of a Kmoyennes algorithm.  Run the Kmeans program to perform clustering using a k-means algorithm. By varying the number of clusters (k = 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20), study the variations of "intra-inertia". What do you notice ? What do you think ? We will make a figure for each case and a table to justify the results, we will indicate the cardinality of each group and the table of confusion.      Decision border: You are asked to represent the decision boundaries in the case that has the least strong form. For this, you will need to set 2D mesh; we propose points from -1.8 to 1.8 in steps of 0.05 for example.      A strong form is the element of the learning set that has always been classified together in several classifications (different initializations). Write a script that can find the number of strong forms and the cardinality of these forms. Determine the strong shapes for some values ​​of k (k = 2, 3, 4, 5 for example), and make 25 tests each time.
